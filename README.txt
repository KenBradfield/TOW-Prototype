This is my first game that I've been developing. It is meant as a first person shooter battle area based around tower placements.

I am using the Unity engine along with a tutorial from Gamer to Game Developer for this development.

This game is still a work in progress.
Features still to implement:
Options
Tower building
Creep spawning buildings
create terrian
weapons selection
Scoring System and winning
Mana
block removals
Stats
hurt effects
proper multiplayer across different computers(only works on own system)
